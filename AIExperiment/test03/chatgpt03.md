**User goal (restated):**
Find the most recent stable Docker Desktop release notes and extract the top 5 changes relevant to enterprise IT.

**Plan:**

1. Locate the official Docker Desktop release notes page (latest stable).
2. Identify the version number and release date of the latest stable.
3. Review that release’s notes and nearby recent ones to pick changes of significance to enterprise usage (security, management, update policy, governance, etc.).
4. Summarize the 5 most relevant changes (with rationale for enterprise).
5. Present the summary with version/date context and links to source.

### TOOL CALL

```json
{
  "search_query": [
    {
      "q": "Docker Desktop latest stable release notes",
      "recency": null,
      "domains": null
    },
    {
      "q": "Docker Desktop 4.46 release notes silent updates enterprise",
      "recency": null,
      "domains": null
    }
  ],
  "response_length": "short"
}
```

Rationale: To fetch the official release-notes page and any recent announcement about 4.46.

**TOOL RESULT SUMMARY:**

* The Docker Docs “Docker Desktop release notes” page shows version **4.47.0** as of Sept 25, 2025. ([Docker Documentation][1])
* A blog post describes Docker Desktop 4.46 introducing “silent component updates & redesigned update experience,” aimed at productivity and enterprise controls. ([Docker][2])

---

From the release notes page:

* Latest stable version: **4.47.0** (released 2025-09-25) ([Docker Documentation][1])
* The 4.47.0 entry is minimal — just a Mac-specific fix around `com.docker.vmnetd` / `com.docker.socket` update bug. ([Docker Documentation][1])
* The 4.46 announcement gives insight into changes not yet fully in 4.47 but rolled out. ([Docker][2])
* The Docker Desktop cadence has accelerated: starting from 4.45, updates ship every two weeks. ([Docker][3])

Because 4.47 has minimal notes, the changes from 4.46 (and the release-cadence and enterprise controls described) are highly relevant for enterprise IT.

Thus, I’ll focus on summarizing major enterprise-focused changes introduced in 4.46 (and supported by context) which are likely part of the stable channel.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Silent component updates (background updates)**                                                 | Docker Desktop components (Scout, Compose, Ask Gordon, Model Runner) now auto-update quietly in background without requiring restarts or user intervention. ([Docker][2])                                                                                                                                             | Reduces disruption and support burden; ensures that endpoint dev environments stay patched (security, feature updates) without manual steps.                 |
| **Enterprise governance over update behavior**                                                    | For Docker Business subscribers, admins can lock, configure, or disable automatic updates via policies in the Admin Console (Desktop Settings Management). ([Docker][2])                                                                                                                                              | Enables centralized control and compliance in organizations (e.g. approve updates, restrict unapproved components).                                          |
| **Accelerated release cadence**                                                                   | As of 4.45, Docker Desktop shifts to bi-weekly releases, aiming toward weekly. ([Docker][3])                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Shorter time to deliver fixes and security patches; but also requires enterprises to adapt testing and rollout strategies for more frequent updates.         |
| **Bug fix: component update behavior / maintenance of `com.docker.vmnetd` / `com.docker.socket`** | In 4.47.0, they addressed a Mac bug that prevented Docker Desktop from updating `com.docker.vmnetd` or `com.docker.socket` to newer versions. ([Docker Documentation][1])                                                                                                                                             | Prevents stale or insecure system components on Macs; ensures consistent component upgrade paths.                                                            |
| **Sign-in enforcement & installation improvements (background context)**                          | Earlier (2024) Docker introduced MSI installer for Windows with sign-in enforcement alternatives, allowing enforcing allowed orgs via registry / flags. ([Docker][4]) Also, via Docker platform release notes: “Enforcing sign-in via configuration profiles is now generally available.” ([Docker Documentation][5]) | Important for license compliance, access control, enforcing that only authorized users or machines run Docker Desktop, especially in regulated environments. |

**Version & context summary:**

* The **latest stable Docker Desktop is 4.47.0** (Sept 25, 2025) with a Mac-specific fix. ([Docker Documentation][1])
* The significant changes of interest for enterprise IT largely stem from **4.46**, in which Docker introduced silent component updates, governance policies, and a refreshed update UX. ([Docker][2])
* The shift to a more rapid release cadence (bi-weekly) underlies this change and affects how enterprises must manage updates. ([Docker][3])

**WHAT I DID vs. PLAN**

* ✅ Located latest stable release notes (step 1 & 2)
* ✅ Identified version number and description (4.47.0)
* ✅ Recognized that 4.47’s notes are minimal, so used context from 4.46 to get substantive enterprise-relevant changes
* ✅ Selected 5 changes important to enterprise (policy, updates, security, control)
* ❓ Did not dig into every minor bug in 4.47 because they were not enterprise-impacting
* ✅ Provided summarized table and rationale

If you like, I can also check earlier versions (4.45, 4.44 etc.) for other enterprise changes and package a cumulative view. Do you want me to do that?
