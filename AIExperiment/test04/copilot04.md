# CTO Briefing: **Kubernetes 1.31** — What Changed That Impacts Regulated Enterprises

**TL;DR**  
Kubernetes **1.31 (“Elli”)** strengthens baseline security (notably **AppArmor GA**) and improves network reliability, but it also tightens crypto hygiene (SHA‑1 certificate support is on its last legs due to Go policy). For regulated environments, the net effect is positive—provided you proactively address certificate, admission/webhook, and upgrade‑window governance. [1](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/13/kubernetes-v1-31-release/)[2](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/)

## 1) Release cadence & support window (what it means for regulated ops)

- **Upstream cadence & window (practical view).** Kubernetes typically ships **~3 minor releases/year**; managed platforms layer their own support windows on top. EKS, for example, offers **~14 months of standard support per minor**, with **paid extended support** if you need to linger on older versions—key when audits or freeze periods delay upgrades. [3](https://www.plural.sh/blog/kubernetes-versions-guide/)[4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html)  
- **Implication for 1.31.** 1.31 remains a supported target on mainstream managed services today, but you should plan upgrades with the above window in mind, and budget for premium/LTS options if you must hold a regulated estate on a given minor longer. (See AKS pricing/tiers below.) [4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html)

---

## 2) What materially changed in **1.31** for regulated enterprises

- **AppArmor support is now Stable (GA)**—policy‑as‑code for workload confinement moves from annotations to first‑class `securityContext.appArmorProfile` fields, improving enforceability and auditability (e.g., with Gatekeeper/Kyverno). This is directly useful for CIS/ISO/BAIT controls around least privilege. [1](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/13/kubernetes-v1-31-release/)[5](https://www.nops.io/blog/kubernetes-31/)  
- **Ingress reliability improvements in kube‑proxy** reduce connection drops during node/endpoint transitions—important for high‑availability SLAs and change‑freeze windows where retries/timeouts are tightly governed. [1](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/13/kubernetes-v1-31-release/)  
- **Networking & scale knobs for large clusters**: **nftables backend for kube‑proxy (Beta)** and **Multiple Service CIDRs (Beta)** help manage large IP spaces and rule‑set performance—relevant for segmented, highly regulated networks (enable only after non‑prod validation). [5](https://www.nops.io/blog/kubernetes-31/)[6](https://collabnix.com/whats-new-in-kubernetes-1-31-release/)  
- **Storage & operability**: **`lastTransitionTime` for PersistentVolumes** improves auditable timelines/SLOs for storage state changes—useful for incident forensics and compliance evidence. [6](https://collabnix.com/whats-new-in-kubernetes-1-31-release/)

## 3) Notable breaking/deprecating themes to factor into audits

- **SHA‑1 certificate support is being removed by Go 1.24** (upstream runtime change). If you still run **webhooks or aggregated API servers** with private CAs signing **SHA‑1**, plan immediate CA rotation; future Kubernetes builds on newer Go will **reject** such certs. [2](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/)  
- **API/feature churn continues under Kubernetes deprecation policy**—while 1.31 itself follows the standard guardrails, regulated estates must track deprecations each minor to avoid “surprise” removals in subsequent upgrades. (Use internal conformance tests against your admission policies.) [2](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/)

## 4) Security advisories & patches relevant to **1.31** estates

- **CVE fixes in the 1.31 patch train** include issues like **CVE‑2025‑5187** (node self‑deletion via `OwnerReference`) and **CVE‑2025‑0426** (kubelet checkpoint API DoS). Staying on **latest 1.31.x** is essential; incorporate these into your **patch SLOs** and change windows. [7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md)  
- Historical example to validate control coverage: the **gitRepo volume** RCE (CVE‑2024‑10220) was fixed starting **v1.31.0**—ensure you’ve banned gitRepo volumes and use init‑containers instead; add detection to your cluster policies. [8](https://discuss.kubernetes.io/t/security-advisory-cve-2024-10220-arbitrary-command-execution-through-gitrepo-volume/30571)

---

## 5) Managed Kubernetes **pricing/tiers** that affect regulated timelines

- **EKS**: Standard support (~14 months) with **optional paid extended support** per **cluster‑hour**—useful when audit scope prevents timely upgrades but increases OpEx; model this in TCO. [4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html)  
- **AKS**: Pricing page clarifies **tiers**—**Free**, **Standard (SLA)**, and **Premium (Long‑Term Support add‑on)**; Premium/LTS is designed for workloads that **must** stay longer on a minor, typical for regulated change regimes. [9](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/kubernetes-service/)

---

## **Three actionable decisions (next 30–90 days)**

1) **Mandate AppArmor GA usage org‑wide**:  
   - Migrate from annotation‑based profiles to `securityContext.appArmorProfile`.  
   - Enforce with admission policy (deny Pods lacking approved profiles).  
   - Update build pipelines to validate profile references.  [1](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/13/kubernetes-v1-31-release/)[5](https://www.nops.io/blog/kubernetes-31/)

2) **Launch a “No‑SHA‑1 anywhere” program**:  
   - Inventory all webhook/aggregated API server certs; rotate CAs to SHA‑256+.  
   - Add continuous checks to block SHA‑1 issuance in PKI workflows.  [2](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/)

3) **Set a managed‑K8s support posture**:  
   - Decide now whether to use **EKS Extended Support** or **AKS Premium/LTS** for clusters that cannot move off **1.31** within the standard window; update budgets and change calendars accordingly.  [4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html)[9](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/kubernetes-service/)

## **Three migration risks to mitigate**

- **Crypto breakage risk**: Workloads depending on SHA‑1‑signed certs (internal CA, legacy webhook) can **fail** after Go 1.24 adoption—treat as a **compliance and availability** risk; pre‑prod test with SHA‑1 disabled. [2](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/)  
- **Network path variance**: Opting into **nftables** or relying on kube‑proxy ingress changes without thorough soak can expose integration gaps (CNIs, observability). Gate behind feature flags and blue/green validation. [5](https://www.nops.io/blog/kubernetes-31/)[6](https://collabnix.com/whats-new-in-kubernetes-1-31-release/)  
- **Unpatched 1.31 clusters**: Missing recent **1.31.x** patches leaves you open to known CVEs (e.g., CVE‑2025‑5187; CVE‑2025‑0426). Tie patch SLAs to security policy and enforce drift detection. [7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md)
