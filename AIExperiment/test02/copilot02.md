Below is a concise, enterprise‑focused comparison (as of **today**) with inline citations.  

### GPT‑5 (OpenAI) vs. Llama 3.2 (Meta) — Enterprise Snapshot

| Category | **GPT‑5 (OpenAI)** | **Llama 3.2 (Meta)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Licensing** | Proprietary, accessed via OpenAI products and API; governed by OpenAI’s commercial terms (not open‑weight). Public launch materials position GPT‑5 as OpenAI’s new default model family for ChatGPT and API. [1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/)[2](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) | Released under the *Meta Llama Community License* (non‑open‑source but permits commercial use subject to terms). Meta’s official Responsible Use Guides accompany the release and emphasize policy‑bound usage. *Exact 3.2 license language should be confirmed in the current license text.* [3](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/sept-responsible-use-guide)[4](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/responsible-use-guide/) |
| **Commercial usage** | Marketed for work use; OpenAI positions GPT‑5 for coding, analysis, and agentic workloads, with rollouts across ChatGPT business tiers and the API. [1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/)[5](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-new-era-of-work/) | Broad commercial use permitted under the community license (with restrictions/acceptable‑use requirements). Meta provides guidance for responsible deployment in production contexts. [4](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/responsible-use-guide/)[3](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/sept-responsible-use-guide) |
| **Model access** | Available in ChatGPT (default), with GPT‑5 variants (e.g., “GPT‑5 thinking/pro”) and API access via the OpenAI platform models catalog. [1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/)[2](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) | Obtainable as model weights for self‑hosting (on‑prem or cloud) and via popular ML hubs/integrations; Meta provides documentation and “responsible use” implementation guidance. [3](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/sept-responsible-use-guide)[4](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/responsible-use-guide/) |
| **Safety / compliance summary** | Emphasizes a new “safe completions” paradigm; extensive red‑teaming (≈5,000 hours) and Preparedness‑Framework workflows; stronger safeguards for high‑risk bio/chem domains; reduced hallucinations and deceptive behavior vs. prior models. [1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/) | Meta publishes Responsible Use Guides detailing risk mitigations (alignment, RLAIF/RLHF, red‑teaming, privacy adversarial testing, tool‑use controls, transparency/reporting). *Compliance outcomes depend on the deployer’s system‑level controls.* [3](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/sept-responsible-use-guide)[4](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/responsible-use-guide/) |
| **Modalities** | Multimodal reasoning with text & vision; official API specs list text+image input and text output for the GPT‑5 API family (audio not supported in that spec). [1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/)[6](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5) | First Llama generation with *multimodal* capability; Meta highlights image reasoning and related multimodal considerations in the 3.2 guide. (Native speech I/O not indicated in Meta’s docs reviewed here.) [3](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/sept-responsible-use-guide) |

### Assumptions & Uncertainties
- **Llama 3.2 license text:** I relied on Meta’s Responsible Use Guides to characterize licensing and usage posture; confirm details (per‑version terms, any thresholds/conditions) in the **current** “Meta Llama Community License” for 3.2.¹ [3](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/sept-responsible-use-guide)[4](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/responsible-use-guide/)  
- **OpenAI legal/commercial terms:** This page focuses on product/technical statements from GPT‑5 launch and model listings; for enterprise data‑use guarantees (e.g., training‑off by default) and contractual terms, consult OpenAI’s latest Terms, Privacy, and Enterprise documentation.¹ [1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/)[2](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)  
- **Modalities scope:** GPT‑5 launch materials emphasize improved multimodal reasoning; API spec snippet referenced shows text+image (no audio) for the *GPT‑5 API* endpoint. Llama 3.2 docs highlight image reasoning; I did not review a dedicated 3.2 model card within the budget.¹ [1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/)[6](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5)[3](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/sept-responsible-use-guide)
