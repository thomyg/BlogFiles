Here’s a tight, one-pager comparing GPT-5 and Meta Llama 3.2 for enterprise use (as of **26 Sep 2025**). I stayed within your research budget: 2 searches and 1 page visit; only the GPT-5 system card was opened and is cited.

| Area                            | **GPT-5 (OpenAI)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Llama 3.2 (Meta)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Licensing**                   | Proprietary model; access via OpenAI services (ChatGPT/ChatGPT Enterprise/API). Terms governed by OpenAI’s commercial TOS and product agreements. ([OpenAI][1])                                                                    | Open-weights release under Meta’s Llama license (free for research & commercial use with usage restrictions/Acceptable Use Policy); weights downloadable and self-hostable. *[Assumed from Llama 3/3.1/3.2 license lineage.]*                      |
| **Commercial usage**            | Paid usage via API/ChatGPT; enterprise agreements available. OpenAI positions GPT-5 as their most capable general + “thinking” model for production tasks; includes safety-trained “safe completions.” ([OpenAI][1])               | Free use (subject to license terms); typical enterprise paths are self-host (on-prem/edge/cloud) or managed hosting via partner clouds/marketplaces. *[Assumed; confirm in current Meta license/partner docs.]*                                    |
| **Model access**                | Hosted only (SaaS/API). Multiple variants described: **gpt-5-main**, **gpt-5-thinking**, plus **mini/nano/pro**; router selects fast vs. deep-reasoning modes. ([OpenAI][1])                                                       | Downloadable weights (sizes vary); accessible via OSS tooling and major clouds’ model catalogs; supports on-device/edge for smaller sizes. *[Assumed from Meta’s Llama 3.x announcements and distribution norms.]*                                 |
| **Safety / compliance summary** | System card details safety training (“safe-completions”), reduced hallucinations/sycophancy, and Preparedness Framework safeguards (treats **gpt-5-thinking** as “High” in bio/chem capability with added controls). ([OpenAI][1]) | Meta provides a Responsible Use guide and AUP with red-team notes for Llama releases; enterprise compliance depends on the deployment environment you choose (your infra = your controls). *[Assumed; verify current Llama 3.2 safety notes/AUP.]* |
| **Modalities**                  | Text + vision; OpenAI describes a unified system that routes between fast vs. deep-reasoning models; focus on writing, coding, health tasks; improved instruction following. ([OpenAI][1])                                         | Text and **vision** variants (incl. small/medium VLLMs); lightweight text-only models for edge/mobile. No native audio/video generation in base release. *[Assumed from Llama 3.2 announcement details.]*                                          |

### Assumptions & Uncertainties

* **Llama 3.2 licensing & deployment**: I assumed continuity with prior Llama licenses (open weights with AUP and certain restrictions) and standard self-hosting/partner-cloud access. Please confirm against Meta’s current Llama 3.2 license page.
* **Llama 3.2 safety posture**: I assumed Meta continues providing AUP/Responsible Use guidance and red-team notes similar to Llama 3/3.1; specifics (benchmarks, evals, restricted use lists) should be checked in the 3.2 blog/model card.
* **GPT-5 commercial terms**: I avoided granular claims (e.g., certifications, data use defaults, pricing) since they’re not in the cited system card; consult current OpenAI Enterprise terms for those details.
* **Modalities scope**: For both models, I focused on text/vision; specialized variants (e.g., code-optimized or edge-tuned) may change availability and terms.
* **One-page-visit limit**: Only OpenAI’s system card was opened; Meta items are inferred from prior releases and could have changed.

*Want me to re-run with one Meta source instead (e.g., the Llama 3.2 announcement/licensing page) and rebalance the table? I can swap the single page-visit to Meta and keep GPT-5 as assumptions if that’s more useful for you.*
