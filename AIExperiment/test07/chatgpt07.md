(B) **Final Answer (following A)**

### Executive Brief (~500 words)

For regulated enterprises maintaining evolving internal knowledge bases, two dominant approaches exist to operationalize GenAI: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **model **fine-tuning**. **RAG** keeps authoritative content outside the model and retrieves it at query time, letting the base model ground answers in up-to-date documents. **Fine-tuning** adapts model parameters using curated examples, encoding organizational style, domain phrasing, and decision patterns directly into the model.

**When to choose RAG:** Choose RAG when content changes frequently (policies, price sheets, SOPs), when you must preserve a single source of truth, and when strict segregation or deletion rights are required. RAG scales with storage and indexing, not with GPU-heavy training, and supports granular access control and redaction. It also minimizes model IP risk because your data is not baked into weights.

**When to choose fine-tuning:** Choose fine-tuning when you need consistent, policy-aligned outputs from sparse prompts (e.g., mandated phrasing, forms completion, classification), or to capture tacit know-how that is hard to retrieve. Fine-tuning can reduce latency and token costs for repetitive patterns and improve adherence to institutional tone and guardrails—especially when paired with instruction tuning and structured output schemas.

**Cost and operating model:** RAG concentrates spend on **data engineering** (connectors, ETL, metadata hygiene), **search infrastructure** (vector + keyword hybrid), and **governance** (access policies, retention). It treats knowledge as live content; updating an index updates answers immediately. Fine-tuning shifts cost to **MLOps** (dataset curation, training runs, evaluation, versioning, rollbacks). Updates require retraining or LoRA merges; governance must track which data shaped which model version.

**Risk posture:** RAG offers stronger **traceability**—answers can cite source passages—and simpler **right-to-be-forgotten** mechanics. Its main risks are retrieval gaps, poor chunking, and embedding drift. Fine-tuning improves stylistic and policy consistency but raises **data minimization** concerns and complicates **incident response** (you must deprecate model versions if tainted). In high-stakes settings, a **hybrid** is common: use RAG for freshness and provenance, add lightweight fine-tuning (or system prompts/reward modeling) for tone, structure, and safety.

**Recommendation:** Default to **RAG-first** for internal KBs in regulated environments; add **targeted fine-tuning** only where measurable gains in consistency or cost exist, and only with robust dataset provenance, versioning, and evaluation. Treat both as products: define SLAs for freshness (RAG) and for model lineage (fine-tuning).

### Pros/Cons Table

| Aspect                | RAG – Pros                                    | RAG – Cons                                   | Fine-tuning – Pros                          | Fine-tuning – Cons                          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Freshness & updates   | Instant updates via re-index                  | Dependent on retrieval quality               | No retrieval dependency                     | Requires retraining for content changes     |
| Compliance & deletion | Easy to honor R2BF; keep data outside weights | Access control leaks if retrieval not scoped | Deterministic outputs from trained policy   | Data baked into weights; harder deletions   |
| Traceability          | Source citations for audit                    | Missing/ambiguous sources cause gaps         | Stable style/format                         | Harder to attribute an answer to a document |
| Cost & ops            | Lower GPU; scale via search infra             | Invest in connectors/metadata                | Lower per-query tokens for repetitive tasks | Ongoing MLOps; eval & versioning overhead   |
| Quality & consistency | Grounds on canonical docs                     | Variable if retrieval misses context         | Strong tone/format adherence                | Risk of overfitting or policy drift         |
| Security posture      | Minimized data-in-model risk                  | Index exfiltration if not gated              | Model can run without data access           | Exposure of training data if mishandled     |

### Compliance Watchouts (with mitigations)

* **Data provenance & minimization:** Log source systems and fields; enforce dataset manifests and DLP on both indices and training corpora.
* **Access control parity:** Align retrieval filters and embeddings stores with IAM/ABAC; test RBAC leak scenarios in CI.
* **Model lineage & rollback:** Version datasets, configs, and weights; maintain signed, time-stamped release notes and a rapid deprecation path.

---

### Assumptions

* Predominantly textual internal content (policies, SOPs, wiki pages, tickets).
* Foundation models are obtained under enterprise terms; private data stays in-tenant.
* Users require auditable answers and frequent knowledge updates.
